*NextQuad* is a hyper-local community app designed exclusively for NYU students — think Nextdoor for college campuses. It brings together dorms, classes, events, and a student marketplace into one verified, private platform.

## What is NextQuad?

NextQuad is a trusted space where NYU students can connect, share, and stay informed about what’s happening right around them. Unlike broad social networks or chaotic group texts, NextQuad focuses on local, campus-specific needs with verified access and safety-first features.

## Why NextQuad?

College campuses lack a unified, safe, and private community platform. NextQuad solves this by verifying users through .edu emails and campus location, creating a clutter-free, trustworthy network for:

•⁠  ⁠Lost & Found alerts  
•⁠  ⁠Roommate searches  
•⁠  ⁠Buy/Sell student marketplace  
•⁠  ⁠Event discovery and RSVPs  
•⁠  ⁠Real-time safety alerts  

---

## Who is it for?

NYU students who live on campus, participate in clubs, study groups, or just want a simple way to stay connected and informed within their immediate college community.
